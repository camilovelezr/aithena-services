# AIthena Services - Docker
These are instructions to set up and serve AIthena Services in a docker container.

## Set up
You will need to set up two different config files:
### 1. variables.env
1. Rename `variables_sample.env` to `variables.env`
2. Replace the values of the environment variables with the correct values
3. *Optional* - Add other environment variables for Aithena Services, (e.g OLLAMA_HOST)

*IMPORTANT:* Do not include quotation marks (") in your .env file, for example:
```
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY="abc123" # this will not work
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=abc123 # this is correct
```

### 2. config.json
1. In `docker/config`, rename `config_sample.json` to `config.json`
2. Manually replace - add - entries for AzureOpenAI models (for Chat and for Embed)
3. You can optionally add entries for Ollama, however, running a PUT request to `/embed/list/update/ollama` or `/chat/list/update/ollama` will add them automatically for you

See [these instructions](docs/api_config.md) for more information.
## Docker Build
From `aithena-services` directory, run `./docker/build-docker.sh`.

This will build a docker image tagged "aithena-services:VERSION".

## Docker Run
Use a command similar to:
```
docker run -itd --name "ais0" -p 8001:80 \
--env-file docker/variables.env \
--mount type=bind,src=/home/aithena-services/docker/config,dst=/mnt/config \
--network=name=ais0 \
aithena-services:0.0.1
```

Args:
* `-p` X:80, X is your host machine port where the FastAPI (running inside the container's port 80) will be mapped
* `--env-file` leave as `docker/variables.env` - assuming you have already correctly followed the steps in the previous section
* `--mount type=bind,src=SRC,dst=/mnt/config` change `SRC` to reflect your local `aithena-services` directory **absolute path**
* `--network` is optional, in case you are running the container inside a docker network

## Test API
Run a GET request to `/test` and you should get `{"status": "success"}`:
```bash
~ $ curl http://localhost:8001/test     
{"status":"success"}% 
```

## Set Up Models
To pull llama3.1 and nomic-embed-text in Ollama and make sure aithena-services FastAPI is aware of these models,
you can run the python script `setup_ollama.py`:

`python3 docker/setup_ollama.py --ollama-host http://localhost:11435 --api-host http://localhost:8001 --internal-ollama-host http://192.0.0.89:11434`

For example, this would be the command if I am running an Ollama container that I have attached to my host's machine 11435 port and that inside the `ais0` docker network has the address 192.0.0.89

## Examples
### Embeddings
```bash
~ $ curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/embed/nomic-embed-text:latest/generate -d \
> "This is a test embedding"
[0.6514015793800354,1.2047090530395508,-3.8498952388763428,...
```

### Chat
```bash
~ $ curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/chat/llama3.1:latest/generate\?stream\=False \
-d '[{"role": "user", "content": "Is the Earth flat?"}]'
