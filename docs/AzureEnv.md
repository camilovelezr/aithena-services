# Azure OpenAI Environment Variables
## OpenAI
```bash
AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION="2024-02-01"
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY="123jfasb38f857d8i43eaf1214f"
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT="https://mygreatendpoint.openai.azure.com/"
```
**Note: Make sure you have turned on the switch at the top to 'Use the new version' and you are using the new version of Azure OpenAI Studio.**

In [Azure OpenAI Studio](https://oai.azure.com), on the bar at the top, click on 'Resources'.

<img src="docs/resources/logo.png" height="150px">

You will see a screen with the values of 'Endpoint' and 'Key'.

For `AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION` you can leave it as `2024-02-01`.

### Deployments

To use a chat or an embed model through Azure OpenAI, you must first 'deploy' it.
To see the deployments you have available, visit [Azure OpenAI Studio](https://oai.azure.com/resource/deployments).

You should see a list similar to:
<img src="docs/resources/deployments.png" height="150px">

For each deployment you will need to set up the following environment variable:
```
AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_{model_type}_{name}={value}
```
* `model_type` can be one of `chat` or `embed`
* `name` is the name *you want to use* to refer to this deployment
* `value` is the name of the deployment in Azure. This must match the name of one of your deployments in Azure

*You can ignore the 'Model-name' that you see listed in Azure OpenAI Studio*

For example, if you want to use the deployment in the picture above (aithena) but you want to refer to it as `ChatGPT`, you would set up:
```
AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_CHAT_CHATGPT=aithena
```
This is equivalent to *"I want to use a chat model that I will call chatgpt through Azure and the Azure deployment is called aithena"*

This would allow you to call the `/chat` endpoint of Aithena-Services REST API in this way:
`.../chat/chatgpt/generate`

---
Let's set up an embedding model:
<img src="docs/resources/embed.png" height="150px">
we can use something like
```
AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_EMBED_ADA02=text-embedding-ada-002
```
This is equivalent to *"I want to use an embedding model that I will call ada02 through Azure and the Azure deployment is called text-embedding-ada-002"*

This would allow you to call the `/embed` endpoint of Aithena-Services REST API in this way:
`.../embed/ada02/generate`
